Content Recycler, as the name implies, recycles your old content so they show up on the blog page as if they were newly published.

== Description ==

If enabled, this plugin checks if you haven't posted anything in a while and reuses the oldest post by updating it's published date. This is useful if you go on a vacation or simply become too busy to update your site. Making your blog page (usually the homepage) always "fresh" from the SEO and users' point of view.

Affiliate marketers could also benefit from this functionality, aside from the SEO and blog page freshness, by putting the old affiliate links back to the front, effectively recycling content.

The same goes for bloggers who have read-worthy posts but are buried deep down the hundreds of newer posts.

The threshold time can be configured from as low as one hour, for really active websites that want to appear to still be active during writer downtimes, up to eternity (PHP max integer number of hours). The recommended value is between 24 – 72 hours. But it's really up to you. An option to recycle nonhierarchical custom post types is also provided, in case that functionality is required.

A manual "Recycle Now" button is also provided. And finally, posts can be skipped by the recycling process by providing their **ID**s or **slug**s.
